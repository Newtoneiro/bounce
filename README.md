Bouncing ball simulation

To start simply run main.py.

Grab the ball and move it to designated position, acting like you're creating a vector. That's how i calculate the velocity of the ball so whenever you move the ball arround,
terminally what matters is it's final position and time taken to move the ball.

(Its hard to make some valueable screenshoots of the interface thats literally one giant ball)
